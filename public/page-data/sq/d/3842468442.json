The hike itself was absolutely spectacular and I cannot recommend exploring this untouched coastal area enough. The overnight camps were in perfectly pristine locations, all next to beaches and estuaries and we were well looked after by the friendly guides and camp managers. I would never visit this area with a different company - Sarah/Active Escapes were superb and made for an unforgettable and incredible hiking experience and Im already trying to figure out dates to organise another - If you haven't visited the area or used Active Escapes before - go do so NOW!!!!!","time":1599477700,"id":"GooglePlaces__Review__1599477700"}},{"node":{"author_name":"Blaise Peccia","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105452274379274529684/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZiT0ntp01gI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucmObdcRRzhapOzpfwek2igw66pcJA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"text":"I got in touch with Active Escape to prepare a cycling trip at the Wild Coast.

The combination of taking a middle aged team of trekkers to their healthy limit  during the day and facilitating 4 convivial lodge locations for the evening unwind was an amazing eye opener for our group. Active Escapes arranged our international links, challenging trekking ( Amphitheatre and Cathedral Peak in particular ), guides, porters and accommodation. Sarahâ€™s patience, enthusiasm and constant smile only added to the experience. 20 new converts to the wilds and wonders that the SA outdoors has to offer.
