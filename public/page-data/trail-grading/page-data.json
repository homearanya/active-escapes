A typical example: you may be able to do 30 burpees in the gym without breaking a sweat, but have never actually physically climbed a mountain with a 15% incline and a backpack.</p>\n<p>It is an <em>estimate</em> for how much energy you are likely to exert on a daily basis for this particular trail. Our scale starting at Level 1, assumes a level of <em>activity</em>. Obviously, the scale is subjective based on one’s current level of fitness, so it also assumes that you are coming on to the trail as a person with a moderate to good level of ‘general’ fitness.</p>\n<p>Here is a description for our Physical Fitness grading:</p>\n<figure>\n  <table class=\"perceived\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>Level</th>\n        <th>Difficulty</th>\n        <th>Description</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>Very light exertion</td>\n        <td>\n          Your breathing remains unchanged.

Heart rate, in\n          the ‘Health Improvement Zone’ creeps up to around 55% of your\n          maximal heart rate.\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td>Moderate activity</td>\n        <td>\n          You will be breathing more heavily, but able to maintain short\n          conversations.

No hiking product can be at this level\n          continuously, but you could reach this level on some sections of\n          high berg ascents\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</figure>\n<h3><strong>B)</strong> <strong>Technicality</strong></h3>\n<p>The technicality rating of the trip is an interplay of terrain difficulty / surfaces (i.e. rocky, sandy, loose scree etc.), route severity / steepness and the general climate / conditions.</p>\n<p>On each trail product, when rated, we try to provide an explanation or further details as to what contributes to its score.

The\n            surface is generally smooth, firm and free of unavoidable\n            obstacles.

Trails may\n            entail walk or wade-through river crossings, have sections that\n            are near to the edge, or vertigo-inducing parts. Generally,\n            10-15km in daily distance. A cleared path is available for most of\n            the trail, but there can be sections that are slippery, overgrown,\n            loose or rough.\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            likely to be a good balance between forestry roads, farm track and\n            single tracks. Single tracks should be smooth and flowing for the\n            most part, but will have sections which are rockier, looser or\n            have obstacles in the path, which may or may not be avoided. A\n            single track trail can be made and ridden as a Level 3 for the\n            most part, but under wet conditions – become a level 4. Trail\n            gradient is a maximum of 20%.\n        </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td>4</td>\n        <td style=\"text-align: left;\">\n            moderate to hard walking. Gradient is frequently very steep –\n            exceeding 15 -20%. The trail itself is mostly rough going with\n            many natural obstacles – fallen rocks, debris, forest canopy or\n            tides. Some scrambling (use of hands) will be required in parts.\n            The path is often on steep ground, or near the edge of cliffs.\n            Those with a fear of heights should not attempt this hike. Daily\n            distances range from 15-25km, though distance is generally not the\n            primary determinant of this grade. Moderate trail conditions with\n            a full-size backpack weight (&gt;15kgs) generally pushes the trail\n            to this rating.\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            likely to be challenging terrain – either 4x4 track with lots of\n            obstacles and or technical surfaces – such as lose rocks (‘baby\n            heads’) or soft sand. The route may have a high percentage of\n            single-track with variable surfaces, steep gradients, drop-offs,\n            sketchy hairpins, slippery substratum, and large obstacles in the\n            trail that need to be ridden over rather than avoided.\n        </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td style=\"text-align: left;\">\n            Very few of our slackpacking trails are graded level 5, in fact\n            only the high-berg multi-day trails. However, a level 4 trail can\n            become a level 5 under bad weather conditions (storms, high winds,\n            extreme heat or cold). Distance – can be up to 30km/day, but\n            usually the overall ascent (or descent) is a more determinate\n            feature. Level 5 trails have a sustained gradient of 20% or more,\n            over rough or sketchy terrain.\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            Extremely difficult trails – which will incorporate very steep\n            gradients, highly variable sketchy surfaces and unavoidable\n            committing obstacles. One can expect prolonged steep descents or\n            climbs. Average trail grade will be 20% or more, even going up to\n            40-50% in sections. There could be serious exposure either side of\n            the trail. Generally classified as an Enduro or technical XC\n            trail. It will NOT be a downhill course though, unless you are\n            expecting it, and have the appropriate bike and skills to do this.\n        </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n</figure>","frontmatter":{"meta":{"title":"Trail Grading","description":"Crafting naturally good getaways since 2007"},"title":"Trail Grading","banner":{"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.5531914893617023,"src":"/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/d8255/activity-hiking-hero.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/9104c/activity-hiking-hero.jpg 480w,\n/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/a6352/activity-hiking-hero.jpg 960w,\n/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/d8255/activity-hiking-hero.jpg 1920w","srcWebp":"/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/25f09/activity-hiking-hero.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/61be4/activity-hiking-hero.webp 480w,\n/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/1fb14/activity-hiking-hero.webp 960w,\n/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/25f09/activity-hiking-hero.webp 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"}},"publicURL":"/static/9cf1498e9aa1b27822ec65906fb12e67/activity-hiking-hero.jpg"},"heading":"Active Escapes","subHeading":"Crafting naturally good getaways since 2007"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5ebb0c56-b3f1-524c-a9ab-3da7cb953c6f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1362292459","1493626347","2249152690","2422186631","2528279208","3004915460","3260752918"]}
