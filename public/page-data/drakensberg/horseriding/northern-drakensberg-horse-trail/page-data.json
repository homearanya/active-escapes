However, a good level of endurance and overall physical fitness is required for the 'time in the saddle' - which many people underestimate."]},{"question":"Is there an age and weight limit for these trails?","answer":["Yes. There is a rider weight limit of 100kgs (the horses are a smaller sturdy breed). Children should be 13yrs or older, unless solid riding experience (preferably multi-day), can be proven."]},{"question":"What is the best time of year for this trail?","answer":["In the high berg, one can experience 4 seasons in a day. Autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (mid August - Oct) are some of the best months, but for the most stable weather, winter months (June-July) can be the best – chilly starts but generally warm and dry days with a warm lodge to snuggle down overnight.  Afternoon thunderstorms are most common in the hottest months (Nov-Feb)."]},{"question":"Do you run scheduled trips or when can we do these trips?","answer":["We do not run scheduled tours, and will try to accommodate your date request provided you are a minimum of 2 persons, and as per lodge and the guide/horse availability.","The overnight trails are <em>not usually</em> available over a <strong>weekend</strong> (Friday or Saturday night), due to the lodges ‘2-night stay’ policy over weekends. But if the weekend is outside of a popular period (i.e. not a long weekend or school holiday) – we will endeavour to organise it for you."]},{"question":"What riding equipment do we need?","answer":["All tack and helmets will be provided. However we recommend you bring along a small daypack that can carry a water-bladder for easy hydration enroute (In summer months you will need to carry at least 1.5l of water)."]},{"question":"What clothing should we wear?","answer":["Closed shoes (boots or tekkies), long and tight fitting pants (jeans or jodphurs) to prevent chaffe, long sleeve cotton or light wicking top, and sunscreen – NB. The dress code at the overnight lodge is practical casual."]}]},"gallery":{"pictures":[{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7884615384615385,"src":"/static/d87fc795ea6ab476255f272b31a0cf86/04043/NBhorse-paddock.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d87fc795ea6ab476255f272b31a0cf86/f65f9/NBhorse-paddock.jpg
