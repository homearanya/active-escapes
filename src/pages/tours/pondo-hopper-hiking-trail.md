longDescription:
  - Keen to hike the most rugged and pristine section of Wild Coast, but don't feel like the schlep of planning and preparing meals, or bringing little more than you tekkies and a beach towel? Provided your hike is planned for outside the peak school holidays, we can offer a fully supported, fully-catered version of the 3 & 5 night Pondo-Explorer trail.
  - You will overnight at the same East African style tented camps, but all bedding will be supplied. Your main kit bags will be transferred from camp to camp by vehicle, so you need only hike with a light daypack. Dinner, Breakfast and a packed lunch for each trail day, will be provided by the tented camps and your third night is spent at Mbotyi River Lodge.

  description:
    - Overnighting in the same East African style tented camps as the pondo-explorer, but with all bedding supplied. Your main kit bags will be transferred from camp to camp by vehicle, so you need only hike with a light daypack. Dinner, Breakfast and a packed lunch for each trail day will be provided by the tented camps and your third night is spent at Mbotyi River hotel.
    - The tented camps all have superb locations - sheltered under the milkwoods overlooking an estuary, or perched on a hillside offering panoramic sea views. This fully supported hike is a fantastic trail to do with a group of friends looking for a hike that is within reach of the average hiker and with enough activities - like canoeing up the estuaries, fishing and swimming, to keep the Duracell bunnies active.

    - question: How do I get to the start of the trail?
      answer:
        - 'If you are self-driving, we will collect you from the hike finish-point: Port St Johns on the 5 night trail or Mbotyi for the 3 night trail. You will leave your vehicle in secure parking in PSJ or Mbotyi and be transferred to Msikaba – the hike start for both the 3 & 5 night trail. This transfer is included in the hike price.'
        - If you are flying, we can arrange private transfers from the airport. Mtata is the closest airport (1.5hr from PSJ) but there are only direct flights from JHB. Durban or East London are the next closest  airports (5- 6hr transfer). If the group is flying – we will arrange transfers directly to Msikaba (trail head) and back from Port St Johns (trail-end) – please request a quote for these extra transfers.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine brings lots of marine action, but we do struggle to get a booking at Mbotyi hotel as it is block-booked by the sardine tour operators.
        - We unfortunately cannot offer this supported hiking trail over the peak school holidays as the camps need to give priority to long-stay bookings.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - For this trail, heavier hiking boots are not necessary. A hiking type shoe or trail running sneaker with good grip is perfect.
    - question: Do you cater for vegetarians and other dietary constraints?
      answer:
        - Vegetarian is no problem at all, but we do need to be given good advance warning. Other dietary constraints need to be assessed on a case-by-case scenario and a surcharge may apply. The shops in the area are limited and the nearest health shop is over 300kms away.
    - question: What about drinks?
      answer:
        - Tea and coffee, and juice at meals is provided, but for all other drinks (both alcoholic and soft) – you will need to bring your own, and these will be transferred along with your bags from camp to camp by the support vehicle. Space is limited, and the roads are rough, so your drinks need to be properly packaged (cooler or box) and please avoid glass.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - The 3 and 5 night trails are the standard catered options. It is possible to spend an extra day-night at Mbotyi hotel should you want.
