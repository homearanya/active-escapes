longDescription:
  - This is a great option for persons short on time, who want to hike the Wild Coast, but within easy accessibility of Durban. The hike to Mtentu is 2 days, overnighting at a village homestay the first night, and then hiking through to Mtentu Lodge for another two nights. The hike goes through the Pondoland Centre of Endemism (a specialist plant guide can be organised for botanical enthusiasts), with the Mzamba fossils and the red dunes being other natural highlights. These dunes, and the Xolobeni community in which you overnight, are at the heart of the proposed mining battle.
  - The village homestay is basic but provides an excellent cultural experience. Mtentu Lodge provides wood and thatch accommodation. All bedding and meals are provided. On your free exploration day, you can hike into neighbouring Mkambathi Reserve or take a canoe up the beautiful Mtentu estuary and do the epic Swallowtail Falls kloofing hike.
  - On departure day – we will provide you with a 4x4 transfer back to your vehicle left at the Wild Coast Casino.

    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - It is possible, and feasible for a larger group,  but local porters are a better option for smaller groups.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - A hiking type shoe or trail sneaker is perfect for this trail.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds. Please try avoid the school holiday periods as the lodge is very popular over these times.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened to two days?
      answer:
        - Yes it can, or it can be extended with extra nights at Mtentu. Or consider our longer Pondo-Voyager trail.
    - question: Is it possible to self-cater?
      answer:
        - No. Mtentu lodge does not offer a self-catered option.
