  title: Amphitheatre Heritage Hike
  description: A mighty wall of basalt which rises over 1000 metres from the Tugela Valley to the Lesotho plateau nearly 3000 metres above sea level, the Northern Drakensberg's Amphitheatre, gains much of its aesthetic appeal from its near perfect symmetry - extending as a sheer wall of rock some 5 kilometres in length from the Eastern Buttress to the Sentinel Peak in the west - altogether an area of majestic and incomparable beauty.

longDescription:
  - A mighty wall of basalt which rises over 1000 metres from the Tugela Valley to the Lesotho plateau nearly 3000 metres above sea level, the Northern Drakensberg's Amphitheatre, gains much of its aesthetic appeal from its near perfect symmetry - extending as a sheer wall of rock some 5 kilometres in length from the Eastern Buttress to the Sentinel Peak in the west - altogether an area of majestic and incomparable beauty.
  - The Tugela Falls, the world's second tallest falls (and the highest in Africa), plunges 948m over the basalt face of the Amphitheatre, down to Royal Natal National Park below.
  - 'This Amphitheatre Slackpacking Trail has been designed to enable walkers of average fitness to reach the summit and be rewarded by never-to-be-forgotten views: a feat normally only undertaken by  experienced hikers who would camp overnight in either tents or caves.'

  description:
    - By spending 3 days and 3 nights on the route, staying at conveniently located hotels/lodges along the way, and accompanied by an experienced trail guide, it is possible for anyone who is reasonably fit and not afraid of heights, to summit the escarpment. This hike has been planned so that you can walk at a comfortable pace and not be encumbered by a heavy backpack. At the end of the day, you can relax at your lodgings where a soak in the tub, delicious food, and a comfy bed will certainly beat tinned bully beef and a thermorest!
    - On this trail, you'll do 40 kilometres over 3 days of hiking with an altitude gain of 1300m, so it is not a hike for the faint-hearted, but the views are worth every drop of sweat.

        - Today’s trail starts with a well-trodden path which ascends gradually towards the Witches and Zigzags, taking you to the base of the Sentinel massif. From here you’ll follow the contour path below the Western buttress, with the land sloping steeply to the north and east giving you wonderful views of the Maluti’s. The chain ladders are reached after about 3 kilometres. After negotiating the 35m ascent on the chainladders it is only a short scramble from there to the escarpment top, where you can spend the better part of the day in exploration. Mont aux Sources (highest peak in the area) and the top of the Tugela Falls are highlights. Return transfer back to Witsies from Sentinel car park.

  faq:
    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately, vehicle luggage support is not viable on this hike as it is a 6hr round trip from Cavern to Witsies. However, porters (as an optional extra) can be arranged to assist with your main backpack on the way up and back down (on day 1 & 3). However, as all meals, towels and bedding are provided, you literally just need to bring your clothes for 2 days/2 nights on the mountain, so you should get away with a light pack.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Worn in hiking boots or a more rugged hiking shoe with a decent rubber sole.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - In the high berg, one can experience 4 seasons in a day. Autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (mid August - Oct) are some of the best months, but for the most stable weather, winter months (June-July) can be the best – chilly starts but generally warm and dry days with a warm lodge to snuggle down overnight.  Afternoon thunderstorms are most common in the hottest months (Nov-Feb).
    - question: Can this hike be shortened to two days?
      answer:
        - A frequently asked question and unfortunately not an option unless you willing to forgo the middle ‘highlight’ day which takes you to the top of the escarpment and the top of the Tugela Falls. However, you can be back at Cavern by midday on the final day, so there is still time to catch an evening flight out of King Shaka (Durban) or OR Thambo (JHB).
