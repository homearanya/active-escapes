      description: The lakes, beaches and estuary of Kosi Bay really has something for everyone. Our Kosi Lakes hike can be attuned with shorter walking distances, and a greater emphasis on activities. During the months of Nov and Dec, the giant loggerhead turtles come ashore to lay their eggs at Bhanga Nek, whilst from mid Jan – to the end of March, you may be lucky enough to see the baby turtles hatch.

longDescription:
  - The Kosi Bay Lakes hike is an escape into one of the most inaccessible and ecologically special parts of South Africa. It is a region of pristine diversity, consisting of four interconnected lakes and an estuary that opens out into the warm Indian Ocean. It forms part of the protected iSimangaliso Wetland Park, South Africa's first World Heritage Site.
  - This is a flexible trail which can be tailored to suit the time, fitness and interests of the group. The average hike day ranges from 9-12kms, winding your way from isolated beach to cool dune forest, through open savannah, and wetlands.
  - Each day brings a new natural or cultural fascination. From watching the local fisherman spear a mullet in their fish kraals, seeing the loggerhead turtles waddle ashore to lay their eggs (Nov – March), or snorkelling in a natural aquarium. It is a great hike option for families.

  description:
    - On the Kosi Lakes hike, we have two standard offerings. For those that like to unpack and not have to repack their bags until the end, we offer a 4 or 5 night trail <strong>based out of beach camp</strong> for all nights. Those that like to mix-up their accommodation experience, we offer a 4 or 5 night Lakes Trail with <strong>3 nights</strong> spent at <strong>beach camp</strong> and 1 or 2 nights spent at <strong>Kosi Lodge </strong>on the western shore of third lake.
    - There is also an <strong>Exclusive Trail</strong> offering where 1 or 2 nights can be spent at IsiBindi's Kosi Forest Lodge on fourth lake.
    - The trail is led by local community guides who are happy to share their knowledge and heritage, so you leave not only 'refreshed' but enriched.
    - An inclusive boat excursion will take you through the reed channels, with an opportunity to snorkel and visit the Tonga fish traps. These <strong>palisade fish kraals</strong> consist of a guide fence that curves in towards a fish trap allowing the fish easy entry but no escape. Fish moving through the channel are guided into the traps where they are then caught and speared by the trap owner. Ownership of these kraals is handed down through the generations.
    - Other activities such as <strong>snorkelling and birding </strong>are very much part of the hike experience, whilst additional activities like turtle tours (in-season) or specialised fishing trips can be organised on request.

    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - No. Vehicle luggage transfers are provided between the lodges. You need only hike with a daypack with your lunch, water and supplies for the day.
    - question: What type of footwear is best?
      answer:
        - Trainers or strops are best suited to this trail. Strops allows sand to pass through and are great for the estuary crossings, but can cause chaffe when wet. With lightweight tekkies/trainers - just check that they have a solid liner under the upper mesh otherwise sand comes in from the top. Or wear lycra trail running gaiters to prevent sand from getting into the shoe.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - Kosi Bay has a warm to hot and humid subtropical climate. It has an average yearly rainfall of 980 mm with rain occurring primarily during summer from Oct to March, with the most rain from Feb to March. May through to November provides the most pleasant hiking temps, but if seeing the turtles is a high priority, then you should plan your hike for Nov - end of March.
        - Availability is generally not a problem outside of the peak school holiday periods.
    - question: What endemic fauna and flora exists?
      answer:
        - Kosi Bay is a sanctuary for many special & protected faunal & floral species. From the ancient Cycads to the most southerly grove of the giant Raffia Palm (whose fronds /leaves are the longest of any plant species in the world) on which the rare fruit-eating Palm-nut vulture depends.
        - The Kosi Lake system is especially important for migratory birds such as the Greater & Lesser Flamingos and Ospreys. The protected lakes provide an important nursery function & supports some of the largest populations of 8 fish species that are listed in the Red Data book for threatened or vulnerable species.
    - question: Is malaria a problem here?
      answer:
        - The Kosi Bay area is still classified as an 'intermediate risk' area according to the Health Department but if you ask the lodges they will tell you this is very outdated. I would only take prophylactics if you are a high risk candidate (pregnant, elderly). Almost all of our hikers dont take, and we have never had a case of malaria reported.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - Our standard trail offering is 4 nights and 3 hiking days. We can reduce this to 2 hike days if necessary. We also have 5 and 6 night options around the lakes, and extra 'lay' days at any of the camps, can easily be arranged.
