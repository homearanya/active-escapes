  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to self-guide but have vehicle back-up support?
      answer:
        - Yes, certainly. If you stick to the beach route in and out, it is quite easy to self-guide, and we still just provide the luggage transfer through to the lodge. However, if you wish to discover the hidden falls and local villages, we recommend taking a local guide.
    - question: How good a mountain-biker do you need to be, to do this tour?
      answer:
        - This is the perfect whetting for a Wild Coast MTB trail.  If you time your trip over a full or new moon period with a spring low in the morning, the long beach stretches through to the lodge should make for pretty easy riding.
    - question: Can we hire bikes?
      answer:
        - Afraid not. The sand and salt also takes its toll on your steed, so if you have the luxury of a ‘B’ bike…but still in good working order, bring the ‘B’ bike. You can also chose to do the inland route in and out if you don’t want to take your fancy bike on the beach.
    - question: It is possible to make this trip shorter?
      answer:
        - It can be a weekend 2 day / 1 night trip by not having the ‘extra’ day at Mtentu if you pressed for time.
