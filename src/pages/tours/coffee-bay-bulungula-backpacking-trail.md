    description:
      - 3.5/ 5 for Fitness. The section between Coffee Bay and Hole in the Wall has some of the steepest hills on the Wild Coast. The relatively long hike distances require that participants have a good level of fitness. However, you need only hike with a small backpack.
      - 3/5 for Technicality. The hiking path on Day 1 contours along steep-sided hill slopes where persons who suffer from vertigo may feel a bit exposed. However, there are no dangerous sections.

      - <strong>Coastal Trail</strong> – on one of SA's most dramatic and beautiful coastlines. Sandy and rocky beaches, lagoons, jutting cliffs, rock formations in the sea, mangrove swamps, rock pools and interesting intertidal life, good birdlife and fishing.

faq:
  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - It is not very feasible. It is much better to organise porters on this hike. Budget around R300/porter/per day. However, with the backpacker shuttles between both Coffee Bay and Bulungula, it is possible to send your main travel bag (your extra gear you do not need to be hiking with) to your end-point on arrival - at your own risk.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Because the terrain can be steep and get slippery / muddy, some groups have said that a sturdier hiking boot with ankle support comes highly recommended. I personally still prefer a hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with a solid sole and grip.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds.
    - question: Is it possible to self-cater?
      answer:
        - It is. The backpackers are well equipped for self-catering. The homestays, however, prefer to give meals as they do not provide facilities for self-catering.
