longDescription:
  - If your idea of a hiking holiday is as much about the chilled wine, a comfy bed and a seafood dinner, then the Lower Wild Coast Hotel-Hopper is your trail.
  - The ‘hotel-hopping’ trail extends southwards from the Qora River (Kob Inn) in the north, down to the small town of Cintsa in the south. The full trail is 6 days in duration, but we offer 3 main trails which cover this stretch - two 5 night/ 4 day hikes (the Meander & Sunshine Trail) and a shorter 3 night/ 2 hike day Minibreak trail which runs from Morgan Bay to Chintsa. Our trails can be adapted as much as your leave and budget allows.
  - The first 3 days of the trail lies to the north of the Kei River in what was formerly known as the Transkei, while the last section extends along the Eastern Cape's <em>Jikeleza</em> Coastal route, north of East London.

overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - This hike is more accessible to younger and older hikers as the terrain flattens out (fewer hills) with paths running close to the beach, or along wide flat beaches.
    - Accommodation is in the characterful old world hotels with 3-course dinners (often fresh line fish and seafood if you time it right), a cooked breakfast to start your day, and a packed lunch to munch-on out on the trail. Porters can be arranged north of the Kei to take your backpack from hotel to hotel, whilst vehicle luggage transfers are possible south of Morgan’s Bay. You can therefore hike burden-free, though you need pack little more than your clothes and trail shoes on this slackpacker.
    - The hiking distances between the hotels, allow ample time to soak in the atmosphere, take a swim and a leisurely lunch along way - arriving at the next hotel by mid-afternoon. Hikers have the option of flying in / out of East London, or driving their car to the start / finish of the trail, and we'll arrange a shuttle to the other end.

        - OR do a longer first day - hiking through to Cebe Guesthouse (19km from Kob Inn, 14.5km from Mazeppa)
        - Today’s route is perhaps the ‘wildest’ - offering a mix of sandy beaches flanked by rippled dunes one side and flat-shelved wave-cut rocks on the other; and grassy banks that pass natural springs and indigenous forests alive with birds and insects.
        - After crossing the Ngqwara River its a combination of beach, flat rocky shelves and grassy tracks before reaching the beautiful Cebe River Mouth. Flanked on both sides with thick indigenous forest, this river mouth is a truly a wild and special spot.

      description:
        - The hike from Cebe to Wavecrest is almost all along the beach, passing the beautiful Bowkers Bay and around Sandy's point.
        - Behind the dunes lies some very interesting artefacts - likely meteoritic in origin.
        - Arriving at Wavecrest by midday or early afternoon, allows one to exlore this beautiful estuary. Canoes are available from the hotel or - tide-permitting - enjoy a boozy sunset cruise up the estuary.

        - From Wavecrest to the Kobonqaba River, you will pass through a lovely section of indigenous forest.
        - After the Kobonqaba River crossing, the trail is easy going. Look out for the last remains of the Jacaranda Shipwreck – a Greek Freighter that was wrecked in 1971 on a voyage from East London to Durban.
        - After crossing the Qolora river it is about another 800m along the beach to Seagulls hotel, or Trennerys, located on the estuary.

  faq:
    - question: Can we get vehicle luggage transfers the whole way?
      answer:
        - From Kob Inn to Morgan Bay we strongly encourage employing porters for the local income earning opportunity it provides. From Morgan Bay to Cintsa, vehicle luggage transfers are included in your tour price. Porters need to be pre-arranged with us but they get paid directly.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - A hiking type shoe or trail running sneaker is perfect for this trail.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be more stable months with less rainfall. If possible, it is best to try avoid the busy school holiday periods. Peak period rates will apply during Dec/ Jan holidays. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphin, and pelagic birds - a great time to hike along this coastline.
    - question: How do the group transfers work?
      answer:
        - We include and cost for a group transfer/shuttle from either the end point of the hike to the start (usually done at the beginning so you hike back to your vehicle) OR return airport transfers (to/from East London airport). Groups need to co-ordinate their flight arrival times. On larger groups, it is possible to do multiple transfers but you will pay for the additional transfers required. It is also possible to collect some of the group from the airport and the rest from the hike end-point, but  additional 'detour' charges will apply.
