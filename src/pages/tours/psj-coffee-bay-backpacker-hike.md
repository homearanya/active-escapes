From the fascinating table mountain sandstone cliffs of Port St Johns, to the arched bays of Mpande and Mdumbi (voted in the top three of South Africa's most beautiful beaches and a surfing hotspot); the impressive dolerite intrusion at Brazen Head and the fabled landmark, Hole in the Wall, where the roar of ocean through this hollowed cliff gives rise to its Xhosa name 'esiKhaleni' - place of sound.
    - On this 5 day guided hiking trail you can chose between overnighting at friendly village homestays, chilled-out backpackers, private holiday cottages, or a mixture of all.
    - The village homestays provide dinner and breakfast as part of their inclusive rate. We include dinner in the backpacker option, and they are also well equipped for self-catering.  We provide a shuttle back to your vehicles left in Port St Johns, or to and from Mtata.

Mngazana estuary, is considered to be one of the Eastern Cape‘s most important estuaries, with the third largest mangrove stand in South Africa.

      subHeading: 'Hike Day 2: Hike from Mngazana – Mpande (14km/ 4-5hrs walk) '
      description:
        - Todays hike follows the inland paths through hills and villages, and in and out of forested valleys. The coastline itself is all rocks and headlands, so there will be no beach stretches today, until you descend to Sinangwana, where the river spills from the forest straight onto the beach.
        - 'Overnight: <strong>Kraal Backpackers </strong> (dinner incl) OR <strong>VBA</strong> (DBB) or <strong>Self-catering holiday cottage</strong> for groups of 6 or more out-of-season.'

      subHeading: 'Hike Day 3: Hike Mpande - Hluleka (18km/6-7hrs walk)'
      description:
        - Today’s hike is one of the more challenging. You’ll ascend from Mpande through pristine forests towards Mthonga mouth - reputed to be one of the most beautiful spots on the Wild Coast. More hills and footpaths take you on a descent to the beach and the Mnenu River which then crosses into Hluleka Nature Reserve  - a combination of diverse eco systems including, rocky seashore, estuaries and evergreen forests.
        - 'Overnight: <strong>VBA</strong> (DBB) OR <strong>Hluleka Nature Reserve</strong> self-catering chalets (Self-catering)'
    - heading: Day 5
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 4: Hike Hluleka - Mdumbi (21km/8hrs walk)'
      description:
        - As the coastline becomes rocks and headlands again, todays paths are made by fishermen and villagers, with some breathtaking views to speak of. The gorgeous Mtakagagie River crossing at just over 4km, provides a great opportunity to soak it all in, and then undulating grasslands and partly vegetated dune paths make up the route to Presley’s Bay and down to Lwandile beach.
        - After crossing the Lwandile River, you’ll come across some of the most southern distribution of mangrove trees before following the coastal contour path through to Mdumbi – voted one of South Africa’s top beach and surf hot-spots.
        - 'Overnight: <strong>VBA</strong> (DBB) OR <strong>Mdumbi Backpackers</strong> (dinner)'
    - heading: Day 6
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 5: Hike Mdumbi-Coffee Bay (10km/ 4hrs walk)'
      description:
        - After a mornings swim at Mdumbi, follow the coastal path past Whale Rock and Anchorage Hotel through to the Mtata river. After a ferry crossing here, you should prepare yourself for a bit of uphill toil as you ascend to a high cliff plateau. Your efforts will be well rewarded by a spectacular view down this rocky coastline. From here you’ll follow an undulating hiking trail, past the old airstrip and along to a vantage overlooking a dolerite stack in which the waves have eroded and created a labyrinth cave system.
        - 'Overnight: <strong>Backpacker</strong> (dinner) OR upgrade to <strong>Ocean View Hotel </strong> (DBB)'

faq:
  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - It is not very feasible. It is much better to organise porters on this hike. Budget around R300/porter/per day.
    - question: How fit do you need to be to do this hike?
      answer:
        - You will need to have a very good level of fitness and endurance for this hike. The daily distances are long and the terrain hilly, so its best suited to the more experienced or fitter hiker.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Because the terrain can be steep and get slippery / muddy, some groups have said that a sturdier hiking boot with ankle support comes highly recommended. I personally still prefer a hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with a solid sole and grip. However, if your backpack is on the heavier side, I would  recommend going with boots for the extra support.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a stable climate for hiking and there is also the sardine run. This is one hike we can usually arrange during holidays as there is usually a homestay alternative.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened?
      answer:
        - Possible, but transfer logistics outside of of PSJ or Coffee Bay are more expensive.
    - question: Is it possible to self-cater?
      answer:
        - Yes, the backpackers are well equipped for self-catering  . The homestays prefer to give meals as they cannot provide facilities for self-catering.
