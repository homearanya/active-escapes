    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - No. You will leave your luggage at your overnight accommodation where you will more than likely stay for the entire hike. All you need is a small daypack for your packed lunch and supplies for the day's hiking.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - A trail running shoe or hiking shoe with decent grip is more than sufficient for this trail.

        - The trail is operational all year round except over peak school holiday periods. During the mild winter months, the area is known for its whale activity. Whales come in to give birth in the quiet protected bays and dazzle us with their displays of breaching and lob-tailing.
    - question: Are there shorter versions of this hike?
      answer:
        - Yes, there are also 2 and 3 night versions of this trail .
