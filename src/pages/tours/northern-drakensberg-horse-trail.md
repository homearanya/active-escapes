  description:
    - High mountains, sandstone cliffs and rolling plains provide a scenic and dramatic backdrop to this Northern Drakensberg multi-day horse trail. A day in the saddle will see you traversing mountain ridges, forging crisp streams and galloping along wide open plains. Guests wishing to include a cultural element in their ride can alter their route to ride through the village,  visiting a local Sangoma, and getting a feel for contemporary rural Zulu life.
    - The sure-footed horses have been bred in the area so whilst the terrain may seem technical, you are on experienced footing. You will overnight in the comfort of mountain lodges, so you get to play cowboy by day... but get to sleep in a real bed by night.

  faq:
    - question: Do we need previous riding experience?
      answer:
        - No, the horses have been bred in the area so whilst the terrain is fairly technical, you are on experienced footing. However, a good level of endurance and overall physical fitness is required for the 'time in the saddle' - which many people underestimate.
    - question: Is there an age and weight limit for these trails?
      answer:
        - Yes. There is a rider weight limit of 100kgs (the horses are a smaller sturdy breed). Children should be 13yrs or older, unless solid riding experience (preferably multi-day), can be proven.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - In the high berg, one can experience 4 seasons in a day. Autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (mid August - Oct) are some of the best months, but for the most stable weather, winter months (June-July) can be the best – chilly starts but generally warm and dry days with a warm lodge to snuggle down overnight.  Afternoon thunderstorms are most common in the hottest months (Nov-Feb).
    - question: Do you run scheduled trips or when can we do these trips?
      answer:
        - We do not run scheduled tours, and will try to accommodate your date request provided you are a minimum of 2 persons, and as per lodge & guide/horse availability.
        - The overnight trails are <em>not usually</em> available over a <strong>weekend</strong> (Friday or Saturday night), due to the lodges ‘2-night stay’ policy over weekends. But if the weekend is outside of a popular period (i.e. not long weekends or school hols) – we will endeavour to organise it for you.
    - question: What riding equipment do we need?
      answer:
        - All tack and helmets will be provided. However we recommend you bring along a small daypack that can carry a water-bladder for easy hydration enroute (In summer months you will need to carry at least 1.5l of water).
    - question: What clothing should we wear?
      answer:
        - Closed shoes (boots or tekkies), long and tight fitting pants (jeans or jodphurs) to prevent chaffe, long sleeve cotton or light wicking top, and sunscreen – NB. The dress code at the overnight lodge is practical casual.
