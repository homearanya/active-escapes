longDescription:
  - The Green and Blue Mountain Trails are four and three - day hikes along the Groenlandberg and Elgin valley - Houw Hoek, Western Cape. Approximately 1hr’s drive from Cape Town. The trail's traverse a tapestry of fynbos, private nature reserves, wine and fruit farms - offering four-star country lodging, fine Cape cuisine and enriched guiding.
  - Daily hike distances range between 11 - 18 km/day, with every day offering a varied terrain and experience.  From picnic lunches at Oak Valley to poplar forest explorations, fynbos on the Houwhoek mountains, or a refreshing dip in a stream along the way. A slack packing trail in this neck of the woods, would not be complete without a few wine tastings along the way. Here Porcupine Hills, Paul Cluver and Beaumont wines come to taste.
