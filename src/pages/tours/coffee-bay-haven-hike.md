    description:
      - <strong>3.5 -4 / 5</strong> for <strong>Fitness</strong>. The section between Coffee Bay and Hole in the Wall has some of the steepest hills on the Wild Coast. The relatively long hike distances require that participants have a good level of fitness.
      - <strong>3 / 5<s/trong> for <strong>Technicality</strong>. The hiking path on Day 1 contours along steep-sided hill slopes where persons who suffer from vertigo may feel a bit exposed. However, there are no dangerous sections.

  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - Porter or vehicle support on this trail is difficult or costly, so it would be better if you could carry your own backpacks. As all bedding and meals can be provided, you can keep your backpack weight to a minimum.
    - question: How fit do you need to be to do this hike?
      answer:
        - You will need to have a very good level of fitness and endurance for this hike. The daily distances are long and the terrain hilly, so its best suited to the more experienced or fitter hiker.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Because the terrain can be steep and get slippery / muddy, some groups have said that a sturdier hiking boot with ankle support comes highly recommended. I personally still prefer a hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with a solid sole and grip.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds.
