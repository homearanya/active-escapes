longDescription:
  - So you've heard about the Xolobeni red sands, Waterfall Bluff and the wild hiking that Pondoland has to offer? Have a tent, cooker and a foldaway pot-set ... but looking for a guide, route, and some logistical support like an end-point transfer?
  - For the adventurous at heart, Active Escapes can arrange 'wild camping' trips accompanied by an experienced local guide, starting out from Port Edward and hiking through to Mkambati (3 day) , Mbotyi ( 5 day), or all the way down to Port St John's on an 8 day Pondo Epic.
  - If you really want to rough-it you can bring your own tent and food along, but we recommend getting a true wild coast experience by mixing this up with some overnights at friendly homestay's along the way. On certain nights there are also 'upgrade' options where you can capitalise on hot running water for a s...scrub and a shave!

overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - The Wild Camper requires that you are experienced backpackers and will come self-sufficient in terms of your own tent, sleeping bag and food provisions. Essentially, we provide the hiking guide to accompany you with his local knowledge for the best overnight locations, sourcing spring water etc, and we take care of the transfers at the end of the hike, to get you back to your starting point (a 3hr transfer from Mbotyi back to Port Edward).
    - If you chose the wild camper option, you can chose to overnight at a homestay on any of the nights, for an extra R350/pp (the cost of the homestay which includes a simple dinner, breakfast & snack).

  faq:
    - question: Can you hire backpacking equipment?
      answer:
        - 'Unfortunately not. You need to have all your own equipment: backpack, tent, sleeping bag, cooker and food.'
    - question: Can porters be employed?
      answer:
        - Yes, potentially, but its more of an exception for elders or someone with an injury. If the whole group is going to need porters – it would be better to look at one of our slackpacking trail options.
    - question: How fit do you need to be to do this hike?
      answer:
        - You will need to have a very good level of fitness and endurance for this hike. You should also have had experience with multi-day hikes carrying a backpack of at least 15kgs.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - When carrying a heavy backpack, boots with ankle support are definitely recommended, though the terrain itself warrants a hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with a solid sole and grip.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds.
    - question: Is it possible to get catering on this trail
      answer:
        - You will get catering if you overnight in any of the village homestays. They provide a simple dinner and breakfast as part of their overnight rate. There are a few small spaza stores along the way for replenishing basic supplies.
