    - As you drive down the R43 between the Overberg villages of Stanford and Gansbaai you have no inkling of the hidden treasures in the hills to your left. This three-day, 26km trail, meanders through pockets of indigenous forest with Tolkeinesque dells of dense lichens, tumbling waterfalls, and you guessed it, exquisite fynbos.
    - "It's a true voyage of discovery, led by expert guides whose enthusiasm is infectious, as they relate the fascinating dynamics between propagator and fynbos. More than 800 different fynbos species have been identified along this route and whatever time of year you walk, there is always something in bloom. From proteas and pins, varied erica’s, delicate orchids, colourful moraea’s, seasonal bulbs, and diverse restio’s; the Grootbos Nature Reserve and Flower valley is a sight to behold."

    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - No. Your overnight luggage will be transported by vehicle. You will just need to hike with a small daypack with your supplies for the day. 
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - The terrain can be a bit lose and rocky so some people will prefer the ankle support provided by a full hiking boot, but below-ankle hiking shoes or trail running shoes will also be fine for this trail.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer: 
        - The trail is closed June and July and over December holidays. All other months are excellent for hiking, but the flowers are at their most spectacular and diverse in Spring (Sept/Oct). Should you do the coastal section add-on, then August to November is best for whale sightings.      
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - The standard fynbos trail is only 2 nights, but you can add on the coastal hike day and night, which comes highly recommended.
