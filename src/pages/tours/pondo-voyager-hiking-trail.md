  description:
    - This is a 5 day / night hiking trail starting at the Wild Coast Casino and finishing at Mbotyi. Led by a passionate local guide, hikers will be treated to warm amaXhosa hospitality at a village homestay in Xolobeni on the first night of the trail. The second night is spent at a community lodge on the gorgeous Mtentu estuary, before entering Mkambati Nature Reserve and walking  through to the Msikaba River, where a night will be spent in an East African style tented camp, nestled amongst the milkwoods. Canoes are available from the camp, and guests can finish the day with a sunset paddle up the estuary.
    - The fourth day's hike takes you from Msikaba to Luphuthana, passing the site of the fated Grosvenor shipwreck and the remnants of the pioneering attempts to recover her treasure. Overnighting at another tented camp, hikers can enjoy sundowners whilst watching the natural spray display that is created from waves crashing up against the flat rock shelf at Luphuthana.
    - The final day's hike from Luphuthana to Mbotyi is the longest, but the renowned landmarks of Waterfall Bluff, Cathedral Rock and Mfhilo falls make for exciting exploration! Finishing at Mbotyi, hikers can treat themselves to a final night of luxury offered by Mbotyi River Lodge.

  faq:
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - It is possible to spend an extra day-night at any of the overnight locations. We can highly recommend a second night at Mtentu lodge, where catering is provided. The paddle-hike to Swallowtail falls is an unforgettable experience. If you looking for a shorter version of this trail – try the Mtentu Explorer.
    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - Not without a lot of extra cost. Local porters are a better option, but they also are a little tricky to arrange on this particular hike as the hike crosses over a number of guide-porter territories.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - A hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with some good grip, is perfect.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Best to try avoid the busy school holiday periods though. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphin, and pelagic birds. Getting into Mbotyi hotel over sardine season is a challenge though.
    - question: Is it possible to have catering provided the whole way?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately it’s not possible to have catering provided at the tented camps unless you go with the pondo-hopper option in this stretch which will significantly increase the price. However, the tented camps are fully equipped for self-catering – so you just need to bring your own food. It is also possible to do this trail in reverse so you get the self-catering nights done in the beginning of the hike.
