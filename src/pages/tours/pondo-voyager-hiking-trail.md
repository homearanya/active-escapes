    - This is a 5 day / night hiking trail starting at the Wild Coast Casino and finishing at Mbotyi. Led by a passionate local guide, hikers will be treated to warm amaXhosa hospitality at a village homestay in Xolobeni on the first night of the trail. The second night is spent at a community lodge on the gorgeous Mtentu estuary, before entering Mkambati Nature Reserve and walking  through to the Msikaba River, where a night will be spent in an East African style tented camp, nestled amongst the milkwoods. Canoes are available from the camp, and guests can finish the day with a sunset paddle up the estuary.
    - The fourth day's hike takes you from Msikaba to Luphuthana, passing the site of the fated Grosvenor shipwreck and the remnants of the pioneering attempts to recover her treasure. Overnighting at another tented camp, hikers can enjoy sundowners whilst watching the natural spray display that is created from waves crashing up against the flat rock shelf at Luphuthana.
    - The final day's hike from Luphuthana to Mbotyi is the longest, but the renowned landmarks of Waterfall Bluff, Cathedral Rock and Mfhilo falls make for exciting exploration! Finishing at Mbotyi, hikers can treat themselves to a final night of luxury offered by Mbotyi River Lodge.

    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately, vehicle luggage support is not viable on this hike as it is a 6hr round trip from Cavern to Witsies. However, porters (as an optional extra) can be arranged to assist with your main backpack on the way up and back down (on day 1 & 3). However, as all meals, towels and bedding are provided, you literally just need to bring your clothes for 2 days/2 nights on the mountain, so you should get away with a light pack.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Worn in hiking boots or a more rugged hiking shoe with a decent rubber sole.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - In the high berg, one can experience 4 seasons in a day. Autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (mid August - Oct) are some of the best months, but for the most stable weather, winter months (June-July) can be the best – chilly starts but generally warm and dry days with a warm lodge to snuggle down overnight.  Afternoon thunderstorms are most common in the hottest months (Nov-Feb).
    - question: Can this hike be shortened to two days?
      answer:
        - A frequently asked question and unfortunately not an option unless you willing to forgo the middle ‘highlight’ day which takes you to the top of the escarpment and the top of the Tugela Falls. However, you can be back at Cavern by midday on the final day, so there is still time to catch an evening flight out of King Shaka (Durban) or OR Thambo (JHB).
