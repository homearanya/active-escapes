  description:
    - This slackpacking trail effectively covers the first 4 days of the Giants Cup Trail, and can be extended to cover the full 5-day 60km trail all the way through to Bushmens Nek. At the end of each days hike, you are ferried a short distance to a comfortable lodge or farmstay, with your bags awaiting your arrival. This means you can hike the trail without the burden of a heavy pack, giving you more time to take that swim in a refreshing mountain pool or photograph the wild flowers along the way.
    - Being a three day trail, it is a good option for a long weekend getaway. For those walkers who want to marry fine dining and more luxury lodgings to the experience, this trail can be upgraded to do so.

      description:
        - After breakfast, you will be transported to the start of the trail, a few km up the Sani Pass road. After crossing between the Mkomazana and Gxalingwa valleys, Ngwenya Pools makes an ideal refresher point, before the trail ascends gradually through attractive country into the Pholela valley. The suspension bridge marks the entry into Cobham reserve, from where you will be collected & transferred to your overnight stay.

      description:
        - After breakfast, you will transfer back to Cobham, and continue the trail. The trail ascends Siphongweni Ridge, past Tortoise Rocks, before traversing its southern flank and dropping down into the Mzimkulwana valley. Mzimkulwana Hut (normally the 2nd nights hut on the GC Trail) makes for a shady rest point, as from here it is a steady climb out of the valley, towards Little Bamboo Mountain.
        - On the top of the ridge you will find a number of small ponds (tarns) where blue cranes frequent, and the remains of a petrified forest. The trail then follows the beautiful Killiecrankie stream, down to Drakensberg Gardens Valley, where you will be collected and transferred to your next night’s guesthouse.

      description:
        - From Castleburn you will again pick up the marked Giants Cup Trail. The first half of the trail ascends the ridge to the west of Garden Castle mountain via the scenic but steep Black Eagle Pass which reaches an altitude of 1900 metres. Many pleasant vistas present themselves as you follow the contour path to the top of the Drakensberg Gardens hotel, at which point you will come down.

  faq:
    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - No. Your overnight luggage will be transported from lodge to lodge on this trail. 
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Worn in hiking boots for ankle support if you wish, otherwise a hiking or trail-running shoe will be fine for this little berg trail. 
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - 'Autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (mid August - Oct) are some of the best months. For the most stable weather, winter months (June-July) can be the best: chilly starts but generally warm and dry days with a warm lodge to snuggle down overnight. The hottest months (Nov-Feb) tend to have heavy afternoon thunderstorms.'
    - question: Can this hike be lengthened?
      answer:
        - Yes, if you have the time, you can do the final hike day which goes from Swiman’s hut (just beyond Drak Gardens hotel) through to Bushmens Nek hotel – approx. 12km. A night at Bushmens Nek hotel is a great way to finish off the trail.
    - question: Can this hike be run?
      answer:
        - Absolutely. It makes a great trail run. The whole trail can be comfortably run in 3 days or over a weekend. There is an event which does this trail, but we can organise it for you as a private run with your friends.
