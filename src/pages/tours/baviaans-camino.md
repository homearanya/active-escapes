overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - This trail is unique but it’s not for the faint hearted!  There is no easy exit, unless it’s a major medical emergency.  There is hardly any cell reception, which is great to ‘be in the moment’ and truly shut-off from the noise of our busy lives. Catering will be wholesome and hearty – warm breakfast, packed lunch and braai's/potjies for supper.

    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
