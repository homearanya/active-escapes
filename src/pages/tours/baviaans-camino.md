overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - This trail is unique but it’s not for the faint hearted.  There is no easy exit, unless it’s a major medical emergency.  There is hardly any cell reception, which is great to ‘be in the moment’ and truly shut-off from the noise of our busy lives. Food is good hearty meals – warm breakfast, packed lunch and braai/potjies for supper.

      description:
        - 'Get to Willowmore before dark – we can arrange shuttles leaving from Kareedouw either before or after the hike, to suit your travel arrangements.  Dinner is served at 18h30.'
    - heading: Day 2
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 1: Nakop - Joachimskraal. Approx. 22km'
      description:
        - After a very early breakfast we will shuttle to Nakop.  The trail starts with a 400m climb over the first 4km, traversing the Baviaanskloof Mountains, followed by a 7km descent into the Kloof.  Overnight accommodation is 5km further, on the farm Joachimskraal in an old farmhouse.  There are 5 rooms available.
        - 'Dinner is enjoyed around the fire, a well deserved treat after a challenging day!'
    - heading: Day 3
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 2: Joachimskraal – Modderhuisie. Approx. 24km.'
      description:
        - The trail starts through some farmland, before you tackle the first two winding uphills of the day where we find the support vehicle again for lunch.  Soon civilization is forgotten and you start the traverse of the Kouga Mountain Range, with uninterrupted views into the Klein Kommando and Tjandokloofs.  You move from thorntrees to aloes, cycads, proteas and spekboom.  95 bird species have been counted along this route.
        - 'The third uphill consists of 3 zigs and 3 zags, while the fourth is a testing path right in front of you that you just must get done.  The last few kilometres through a kloof leads to Modderhuisie at Entkraal, where we all sleep on bunk beds in a small outpost consisting of 3 rooms.'
    - heading: Day 4
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 3: Modderhuisie -  Nooitgedacht . Approx. 20km. '
      description:
        - We start off through the beautiful Kouenek Kortkloof, towards the Joubertskraal River, before you tackle the Kouenek to the highest point, a steep mountain with many false summits!  Then a generous and slow reintroduction to civilization follows, as you enter the remote farming community of the Nooitgedacht area.  We tackle a last up and down for the day before we get to our farmhouse for the night.
        - heading: Day 5
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 4: Nooitgedacht – Nguniland. Approx 30km.'
      description:
        - We need an early start as this is the longest day of the hike (but not the most difficult).  We first enjoy the early morning trail along the Ragels River, before tackling Moordenaarskloof - by now nothing to fear! We descent to cross the Kouga River (and remember what goes down, must go up…) before stopping for lunch.  We then continue to our last night's accommodation through a beautiful fynbos kloof and along the old Pospad (mail trail) where we braai and reflect on the Baviaans Camino at Nguniland Guest Farm.

      description: 
      - Pack up and enjoy a hearty breakfast in a local restaurant, the Sweaty Dutchman, and then it is time to start our journey back to the real world.  As they say though, a Camino has a start, but it never ends.

    - question: Do we carry our own backpacks?
      answer:
        - No. You carry a small daypack with your lunch pack, enough water and own emergency equipment while the support vehicle transports your luggage.  The vehicle also will stop every 2 hours for tea/cold drinks or safari lunch.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Worn in hiking boots for ankle support, if possible one size bigger than normal.  The terrain is rocky so you need support. 
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The trail is only available on pre-set dates between autumn (Mar-May) and Spring (Oct) due to extreme summer temperatures found in the Kloof.
    - question: Can this hike be lengthened?
      answer:
        - Yes, you can convert it into a 10 day hiking holiday if you follow it up with the Chokka Trail.
