      subHeading: 'Arrival / Hike Day 1: Sentinel Car Park – Tugela / Bilanjil Falls (8km/ 600m ascent/ 4hr)'
      description:
        - Vehicle transfer from Witsieshoek to Sentinel car park.
        - Around the base of the Sentinel Massif, up the chain-ladders and summit the escarpment. Camping near the Thukela falls or 1km further at <strong>Bilanjil falls</strong> (2960m).
    - heading: Day 2
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 2: Thukela Falls – Mbundini Abbey overlooking Madonna & her worshippers (16km  / 400m ascent / 7hr)'
      description:
        - From the Amphitheatre, you will head back inland through Lesotho following the Kubeda river.
        - Camping at <strong>Mbundini Abbey</strong> or on the edge of <strong>Fangs Pass</strong>, the well-known feature of ‘Madonna and her Worshippers’ comes into view.
    - heading: Day 3
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 3: Mbundini Abbey to Orange River Source (15km  / min 250m ascent / 7.5hr)'
      description:
        - Dramatic views of <strong>Mweni needles</strong>, the cutback and Rockeries beyond.
        - After making camp near the stream (2860m), provided you have the stamina and the light is good, it’s worth walking out to either the top of Mnweni pass, or <strong>Rockeries Pass</strong> (both about 30mins from camp) for sundowner views.
    - heading: Day 4
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 4: Orange River Source to Twins Cave  (17km  / 250m ascent/ 7.5hr)	'
      description:
        - 'Continue hiking along a river valley which cuts behind the Saddle peaks, until you can cut up to the escarpment edge which offers a superb view over the whole Cathedral Peak range: the Chessmen, the Inner and Outer Horns, the Bell and Cathedral Peak itself.'
        - This is the line of the <strong>Bell Traverse</strong> which you should expect to follow tomorrow, conditions and abilities permitting.
    - heading: Day 5
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 5: Twins Cave – Bell Traverse – Cathedral Peak Hotel  (14.5km  / 400m ascent/ 8hr)'
      description:
        - The Bell Traverse is the ‘cherry’ of hike experiences in the Drakensberg. From the moment you leave Twins cave, a surprise awaits around every corner.
        - 'The impossible path reveals itself in parts. Where it goes next, you cannot guess: around the Mitre, by the Chessmen, behind the Inner and outer Horns, around the Bell and then, before getting to the foot of the Cathedral Peak, the final big daunting challenge: Bugger’s gully.'
        - From here it is a relatively easy 8km down to Cathedral Peak hotel, via Orange Peel Gap.
        - 'Recommend - overnighting at <strong>Cathedral Peak hotel</strong> this final night'

faq:
  faq:
    - question: How experienced do you need to be to do this trail?
      answer:
        - It is not essential for you to have done prior Drakensberg hikes of this nature, but we do recommend that you have previous experience in multi-day hikes over challenging terrain. A high level of fitness and endurance is necessary for this expedition.
    - question: Is it possible to NOT carry a backpack?
      answer:
        - Porters can certainly be arranged, and indeed, recommended for almost everyone. However, porters also need to carry their own shelter and food. If you are looking to carry only a large daypack, no more than 10kgs in weight, than you should budget on approx. 1.5 porters/per person based on a group of 4 or more.  Vehicle luggage transfers are definitely NOT an option on this trail.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - High quality, waterproofed (goretex or nickwaxed) boots with good ankle support and rigid rubber sole, are necessary for this trail.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - Autumn (Mar – May) and Spring (Sept-early November) are the best months for this trail. Winter months generally have the most stable weather, but it will regularly drop below O deg C overnight, and snow is more possible.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened?
      answer:
        - Not easily. Better to look at another of our hike options if you looking for a long-weekender.
    - question: Can you rent equipment?
      answer:
        - You will need to provide your own backpack, personal clothing and headlight. 4-season high mountain tents, sleeping bags and mats can be rented.
