longDescription:
  - '<em>"Relax as hard as you like"</em> is the tune by which things are run at this canvas-and-thatch bush camp, nestled amongst the aloes and acacias of the mighty Tugela River, central KZN. Wake to the call of a Fish Eagle, enjoy an early morning game walk or trail-run, sunbathe on one of the giant boulders in front of camp, or unwind with sundowners, roaring campfires, open-air dining and evening skies awash with stars.' 
  - Whether its adventure, nature, or relaxation that you after, the surrounds and company of this river bush camp offer the perfect tonic. From game viewing, fly fishing and birding, to more adventurous pursuits such as 4x4'ing, mountain-biking, river rafting, abseiling and trail-running, you'll never run short of things to do. And now look out for our scheduled ‘retreats’ of yoga, meditation and other soulful pursuits.

  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - From humble beginnings, this family-run bush camp has evolved slowly over the years. A firm believer that rocks and trees are here to stay, the owners have passionately crafted their accommodation around the natural features of this rugged landscape. Enjoy a river view or a window in to the bush canopy from your outdoor ensuite, or the morning banter of the mocking chats as they hop around your room.
    - Tugela Bush Camp offers a <em>unique getaway</em> for friend and family, boys or ladies retreats and adventurous corporates. Itineraries are tailor-made from the many activities on offer, and experienced facilitators can be brought in. Bonds are created through shared experience and this environment provides the natural playground for this to happen.
    - Most activities are offered year round, but the best month for rafting (summer rainfall dependent) is November through to April. During winter, the river drops and cleans up considerably,  making conditions favourable for fighting Yellow's on fly. The rocky roads and animal tracks around this former biosphere reserve provide organic mountain biking terrain and there is an extensive network of hiking and running paths, created for their annual trail running event, and maintained by wild animals and a dedicated team of trail-blazers. 
    - Have your concept of outdoor living stretched to its limits, down here in the Tugela Valley.

    - question: Where is this camp located and what vehicle do you need to get there?
      answer:
        - Tugela Bushcamp feels like you in true wilderness, but actually its not so far a drive from either JHB or Durban. It is about 4hrs drive from JHB to Colenso (meeting point for non 4x4's) or 2,5hr drive from Durban to Weenen (alternative meeting point). From here it is about an hours drive/transfer into camp. You will need a sturdy high-clearance vehicle - with potential 4x4 in the wet - to get into camp. But if you dont have - we can arrange a return transfer into camp for R750/ 7 seater vehicle.
    - question: Can we hike or mountain bike into camp?
      answer:
        - Yes. You can certainly mountain bike via the road that the vehicles would travel in (actually great mountain-biking), and we are currently finishing off the trails to be able to offer a slackpacking hike in from the Colenso side - with a potential wild camping night enroute. There is also a hike-paddle combo that can be arrranged for groups. So many options, we'll try make your adventure aspirations come true. 
    - question: What is the best time of year to visit this camp?
      answer:
        - In the Thukela Valley you can expect very hot (but dry) conditons during Summer (Nov - Feb) - early morning starts, siesta's over lunch, and a good amount of time spent cooling off in the river, are the order of the day. Winter days are mostly sunny and dry - perfect for trail running and fishing after a lazy start.  The nights do get cold, but we'll make sure you snug under your duvets, and a roaring campfire is all the more enticing. 
    - question: When can we do the 'Retreats'?
      answer:
        - If you are a group of 8 or more, we can organise a Yoga or Special-Interest retreat for you on any weekend - availabilty permitting with the lodge and our instructors. We also going to schedule a couple of 'holistic' retreats during the course of the year so that singles and small groups can join. Another Yoga-Meditation-Nature retreat will be on the cards again, along with Mother-Daughter, Women's Fishing, Nutrition and Couples Retreats. Please drop us a mail if you interested in attending such.
