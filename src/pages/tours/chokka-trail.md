longDescription:
  - The 4 day/4 night Chokka Trail meanders between Oyster Bay, Cape St Francis and St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.  The terrain includes fishermen’s footpaths and jeep-track over two moving dunefields and along the untamed ‘wild side’ of the Kouga shoreline. 
  - Ample birdlife and the chance to see the cape clawless otter while hiking through coastal forest and thicket adds to the excitement of finding century old middens where shells and potshards are scattered between the dunes.

      subHeading: 'Arrival Day/Hike Day 1: up to 19km from Oyster Bay to Thysbaai and back'
      description:
        - Hikers need to be at Cape St Francis Resort by 11am on the day.  The trail owners will meet you here, and transfer you to Oyster Bay, 20km to the west.  Those flying in to Port Elizabeth can shuttle directly to Oyster Bay.
        - From here, you will set off on your out-and-back hike to Thysbaai along the coastline.  This day is unguided, so you will receive a map and route description.
        - Highlights include Thysfontein, a little beach with a holiday cottage, where you might find spoor of the cape clawless otter.  The trail continues past a rock gully, where during low tide you can see circular rock walls in the water – it is ancient Koi-San fish traps, more than 2 000 years old.  Total distance to Thysbaai and back is 19km, but you can turn around at any point.

      subHeading: 'Hike Day 2: Oyster Bay to Dune Ridge. 18km'
      description:
        - On the second day you will be accompanied by an experienced local hiker.  You will traverse the dunes of the Sand River – a dune field mobilised by wind and water.  Wind blown patterns and rare finds of pot shards will take you into another world.
        - At 18kms, this could be the most challenging day of the trail, especially in inclement weather, but nothing beats the feeling of conquering the Sand River!  A shorter route through beautiful coastal thicket, is an alternative -  to discuss with the trail owner. 
        - The trail stops at  <strong>Dune Ridge Country House</strong>, where we recommend pre-booking a massage.
    - heading: Day 3
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 3: Dune Ridge to Cape St Francis. 16km'
      description:
        - As most hikers are reluctant to leave the tranquillity of Dune Ridge, todays start is always a little later. The trail starts out through a beautiful section of coastal forest before reaching the shoreline.
        - Keep your eyes open for grey duiker, mongoose, porcupine quills, bushbuck and caracal.  Once on the coast, look-out  for otters in the rock pools, as well as Oystercatchers, Kelp Gulls, terns, and Turnstones.
        - You will pass Mostertshoek, and walk on the ‘Wild Side’ - so named for the untamed sea that crashes onto the rocks in spectacular fashion.  You will see the second largest blow hole in SA, an unknown grave, the remains of the HMS Osprey that ran onto the rocks in 1867, as well as the Cape Recife (1929).  
        - The day finishes at the <strong>Cape St Francis Resort</strong>, where you will enjoy a sundowner cruise on the St Francis canals before dinner.
    - heading: Day 4
      subHeading: 'Hike Day 4: Cape St Francis to St Francis Bay. 8km'
      description:
        - The last day kicks off on the Cape St Francis beach, and follows the footpaths via Shark Point to Port St Francis, where Clive Cantor from Chokka Block will tell you more about the Chokka industry and serve a calamari tasting.  Hiking past Bruce’s Beauties to Granny’s Pool, here our journey will come to an end with a farewell lunch at Bruce’s Ocean Museum and Café.
        - You will be transported back to the Resort after lunch to collect your vehicles.  If needing to catch a plane this day, you will normally end around 3pm, but can be made earlier if needs be.
