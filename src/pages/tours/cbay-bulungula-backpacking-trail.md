  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to organise vehicle luggage transfers on this hike?
      answer:
        - It is not very feasible. It is much better to organise porters on this hike. Budget around R300/porter/per day. However, with the backpacker shuttles between both Coffee Bay and Bulungula, it is possible to send your main travel bag (your extra gear you do not need to be hiking with) to your end-point, at your own risk.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - Because the terrain can be steep and get slippery / muddy, some groups have said that a sturdier hiking boot with ankle support comes highly recommended. I personally still prefer a hiking type shoe or trail sneaker, with a solid sole and grip.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds.
    - question: Is it possible to self-cater?
      answer:
        - It is. The backpackers are well equipped for self-catering. The homestays, however, prefer to give meals as they do not provide facilities for self-catering.
