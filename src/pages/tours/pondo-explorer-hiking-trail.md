The camps are well equipped for self-catering so you need only bring your food; and porters can be arranged to lighten your load.

longDescription:
  - The northern Pondoland section of the Wild Coast stretches from Mtamvuna River in the north (Port Edward) to the mighty Umzimvubu in the south (Port St John's) and is arguably the most rugged and breathtakingly pristine section of Wild Coast.
  - On the self-catered Pondo-Explorer Trail (3 or 5 nights), you will overnight in East African style tented camps, all in unsurpassed locations. There is a central dining and kitchen boma which is well equipped for self-catering, so you need only worry about your food on this self-catered trail. Porters can easily be arranged if you don’t feel like the schlep of carrying a heavy backpack. The third night of the trail is spent at Mbotyi River Lodge (with dinner & breakfast inclusive) – a welcome bit of pampering along the trail.

overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - We offer a 3 or 5 night hiking package, both starting from Msikaba and either finishing at Mbotyi (3 Night Trail) or in Port St John’s (the 5 Night trail).
    - Highlights of this trail include the deepest estuary in South Africa (Msikaba), the ocean spray spectacular at Luphuthana, waterfalls which plunge directly into the ocean (including the 80 metre high waterfall at Waterfall Bluff), Cathedral Rock, friendly Pondo villages and sweeping vistas. During the annual sardine run (June-July), the ocean is a-frenzy with game fish, dolphins, sharks and myriad seabirds.
    - On this self-catered trail version, extra day-nights can be had at any of the camps or at Mbotyi. It is also possible to break the first hike day into two days by overnighting at Grosvenor lodge where catering is provided.

faq:
  faq:
    - question: Is it possible to have our bags transported by vehicle on this trail?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately not on this trail. However, porters are available at R200/porter/per day. They walk ahead of you and it supports the local economy.
    - question: What type of footwear is appropriate?
      answer:
        - For this trail, heavier hiking boots are not necessary. A hiking type shoe or trail running sneaker with good grip is perfect.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - The Wild Coast has a very temperate climate so can be hiked all year round, but from about March through to November tend to be better months i.t.o less rainfall. Best to try avoid the busy school holiday periods. Winter months offer a wonderful and stable climate for hiking and the annual sardine run brings with it many game fish, schools of dolphins and pelagic birds.
    - question: Is it possible to get catering at some of the camps?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately not. If you want catering to be provided then you need to chose the fully supported and catered pondo-hopper trail version.
    - question: Is it possible to buy food supplies enroute?
      answer:
        - Unfortunately, this cannot be relied upon. There is a larger Spaza store in Mbotyi (mid-way on the hike) where basic food items can be replenished (fresh bread, tinned good, tomatoes, onions, green pepper), but otherwise the hike does not pass through much in the way of villages with spaza stores. Best to come fully prepared.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - The 3 and 5 night trails are the standard options but it is possible to spend an extra day-night at any of the tented camps  or Mbotyi and it is also possible to extend the trail should you want to do this.
