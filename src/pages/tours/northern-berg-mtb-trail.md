    - question: Can we hire bicycles?
      answer:
        - Yes. There is a bicycle hire venue in this valley.  You are looking at about R750/bike for a 24hr period. Rentals are Bergamont Contrail 26" Dual Suspension Mountain Bikes and there are 2 x 29’ers.
    - question: Can we have extra days?
      answer:
        - Absolutely. We recommend an extra day at Drak Mountain Lodge as there is a lovely walk to a Vulture colony and also horse-riding and fishing. An extra day-night at Cavern before or after the trip is always a treat.
    - question: Is it safe to self-guide?
      answer:
        - Yes, the mountain bike trail network is well signed and designed for self-navigation. Our route mapping will be designed around your fitness level with extra loops possible for the fit. We can arrange a private guide if you want to, but most groups chose not to.
