overview:
  heading: At a Glance
  description:
    - Starting out close to the Mozambican border, the route meanders along the top of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising 3280km2 of natural ecosystems. After snorkelling between colourful sealife in the crystalline aquarium of Kosi Mouth, hikers leave Kosi Bay to walk through coastal savannah with a view of the giant fish traps curling far below like an ancient tribal tattoo. The hills are a mixture of water berry trees, monkey apples with their bright green cricket ball sized fruits, and giant flat crown acacias.
    - After a boat trip across Third Lake, hikers are dropped at Bhanga Nek and from here it’s an adventurous walk along sandy pathways, dropping in and out of rural villages, pockets of indigenous bushveld, and small cultivated gardens before the landscape changes once again. The giant Raffia Palms that the area is famous for tower overhead, and views of the tannin coloured Fourth Lake (Amanzamnyama) are visible from the dense forest.
    - Day two and three of walking moves guests from the mysterious inland pathways of the lake systems to the beautiful wide open beaches further south. Beaches such as Black Rock and Lala Nek are picture-book wedges of white sand, edged by snorkeling paradise.

faq:
  faq:
    - question: What type of footwear is best?
      answer:
        - Trainers or strops are best suited to this trail. Strops allows sand to pass through and are great for the estuary crossings, but can cause chaffe when wet. With lightweight tekkies/trainers - just check that they have a solid liner under the upper mesh otherwise sand comes in from the top. Or wear lycra trail running gaiters to prevent sand from getting into the shoe.
    - question: What is the best time of year for this trail?
      answer:
        - Kosi Bay has a warm to hot and humid subtropical climate. It has an average yearly rainfall of 980 mm with rain occurring primarily during summer from Oct to March, with the most rain from Feb to March. May through to November provides the most pleasant hiking temps, but if seeing the turtles is a high priority, then you should plan your hike for Nov - end of March.
        - Availability is generally not a problem outside of the peak school holiday periods.
    - question: Can we do this hike without the luxury lodgings?
      answer:
        - This trail does entail more costly support logistics (more & longer transfers, guide support etc) but it is possible to use some more budget lodging alternatives, and finish at Gugs camp where 2 nights can be spent but the full trail can be hiked down to Mabibi - see Opt D Eco trail
    - question: What special fauna and flora exists?
      answer:
        - Kosi Bay is a sanctuary for many special & protected faunal & floral species. From the ancient Cycads to the most southerly grove of the giant Raffia Palm (whose fronds /leaves are the longest of any plant species in the world) on which the rare fruit-eating Palm-nut vulture depends.
        - The Kosi Lake system is especially important for migratory birds such as the Greater & Lesser Flamingos and Ospreys. The protected lakes provide an important nursery function & supports some of the largest populations of 8 fish species that are listed in the Red Data book for threatened or vulnerable species.
        - From November the leatherback and loggerhead turtles come ashore to lay their eggs, and from about December, the young start to hatch and run the gauntlet down to the ocean.
    - question: Is malaria a problem here?
      answer:
        - The Kosi Bay area is still classified as an 'intermediate risk' area according to the Health Department but if you ask the lodges they will tell you this is very outdated. I would only take prophylactics if you are a high risk candidate (pregnant, elderly). Almost all of our hikers dont take, and we have never had a case of malaria reported.
    - question: Can this hike be shortened or lengthened?
      answer:
        - Yes, we cost from 4 nights / 3 hike days but can add-on as many extra hike or lay days as you request. We do recomend a minimum of 4 nights for these trips though.
