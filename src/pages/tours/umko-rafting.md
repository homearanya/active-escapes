      description: The Mkomazi River boasts Grade 3 rapids, which step-up to Grade 4 if there's been sufficient rain. The section from Daisy Chain to Lower Nkonka is regarded as some of the biggest traversable white-water south of the Zambezi. Just 1hr from Durban and 30-min from PMB, a rafting trip on the Umko makes a great corporate team-build or day-trip adventure.

longDescription:
  - "Experience the thrill of rafting one of South Africa's best white water rivers: the Umkomaas , Zulu name 'Mkomazi' - place of the cows. Situated in rural KwaZulu-Natal between Richmond and Creighton, the Umkomaas River offers warm, high-volume white water, interspersed with short pools to get your breath back and take in the beauty of its untouched valley and gorges."
  - Summertime rafting on the Umkomaas is typically Grade 3, however when the mighty African thunderstorms unleash themselves on the Drakensberg, this becomes a fast flowing, high volume Grade 4 river. No previous rafting experience is necessary, but you do need to be reasonably fit to handle the physical nature of this rafting.
  - Our river guides are amongst the most experienced white water paddlers in the country, and strive to make your rafting experience,  both safe and memorable.

      - <strong>2-4 / 5 - Technicality</strong>. The Umko (during summer) is typically Grade 3 rapids - becoming fast-flow high-volume Grade 4 rapids after heavy rain. As SA rivers go, the Umko is not a very technically challenging river, but is also not a mellow float.

      - The Umko River snakes its way though Valley bushveld, interspersed by pockets of indigenous forest. During summer, the river flows like a roller-coaster of high-volume rapids and big wave chains. Below St Josephine's Bridge the spectacular aloe-hung cliffs fall straight into the river.

faq:
  faq:
    - question: Where does the rafting take place?
      answer:
        - Our meeting point is a camp in the Umkomaas valley - nearest hamlet, Richmond. It is a 90min drive from Durban or 1hr drive from PMB (via the R56). You do NOT need a high clearance vehicle to get here. We will do the 4x4 transfer up-river and return.
    - question: What are your age limits?
      answer:
        - Minimum age of 12 years, and anyone under 18yrs should be accompanied by an adult. However, you can chat to us if your kids are under age but have proven rafting experience or strong swimmers. Decisions will be made (or changed) based on the river-level at the time.
    - question: What is the best time of year for rafting?
      answer:
        - Rafting is entirely dependent on RAINFALL in the upper catchment (central Drakensberg), and is thus restricted to Summer months - generally kicking off from November and extending through to April if we have been blessed with a good season.
    - question: What happens if the river is not high enough after pre-booking?
      answer:
        - This is always the difficulty, and thus we only open up bookings for the season from October.  You need to pay a deposit to secure and we'll notify you regarding river levels in the week prior to your trip. You will get a date postponement or a refund less a small admin fee, if the trip is not possible due to poor levels. We DO raft in the rain though.
    - question: Can the 2 Day/ 1-2 Night Rafting trips be done over a weekend rather?
      answer:
        - Yes, potentially but it will cost a lot more as the bushcamps we use charge a minimum fee and double-rates over the weekends. It is still feasible, however, if you are a large group wanting to do this. OR you happy to bring your own tents for camping or stay in the dorm tents?
    - question: Do I need to be able to swim to partake in this rafting?
      answer:
        - This may seem a strange question, but it's actually one that is asked quite frequently. It seems there quite a few non-swimmers (or weak swimmers) who are still keen to do this activity. So the answer is YES - provided we have a higher guide to client ratio, based on the river levels, and that you will go in the 4 or 6-man rafts  manned by a river guide. We DO need advance notification of non-swimmers, so we can make a call and the best safety arrangements.
