    - The 3-4 day <strong>Midlands MTB Meander</strong> tour is a great introduction to the diverse mountain biking terrain on offer in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Beginning in the foothills of the Drakensberg (Lotheni) and making tracks to the small town of Howick, riders get to experience a diverse mix of landscapes from mist-belt grasslands to wetlands, montane forests and farmlands.
    - Enjoyable at all times of the year, but best during Winter and Autumn months, this tour combines handcrafted trails with pastoral scenery, warm hospitality, and some of the finest cuisine that the Midlands has to offer.
    - Midland's multiday tours are flexible and can be adapted to different levels of experience, fitness and interest. This tour can also be tailored to groups training for multi-stage events such as Sani2C or Joberg2C, with longer daily distances, ascents and more technical route options.

    - question: Do you hire bicycles?
      answer:
        - We much prefer you bring your own. If you are an international couple looking to hire, we will make a plan, but we dont keep a fleet of mountain bikes for hire.
    - question: Do you offer day-trips?
      answer:
        - Potentially, but we prefer to offer overnight (2-4 day) trips.
    - question: What is the best time of year for mountain biking in the Midlands?
      answer:
        - Autumn and Winter months (May - August) tend to be the most stable and dry. Summer months can be lovely, but also a higher chance of rain. Please avoid public holiday long weekends, and Christmas / Easter periods.
    - question: How much experience and fitness do you need for these trips?
      answer:
        - Our multiday tours are flexible and can be adapted to different levels of experience, fitness and interest. We can custom design a trip along quiet country roads (gravel biking) or keep the singletrack flowing to your hearts content.
