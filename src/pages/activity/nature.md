  text:
    - We have so disconnected ourselves from the natural world that it is easy — and often convenient — to forget that nature remains as giving as ever, even as it vanishes bit-by-bit.
    - 'Technology and industry may have distanced us superficially from nature, but it has not changed our reliance upon the natural world: most of what we use and consume on a daily basis remains the product of multitudes of interactions within nature, and many of those interactions have been catastrophically imperilled.'
    - Beyond such physical goods, the natural world provides less tangible, but just as important, gifts in terms of beauty, art, and spirituality.
    - Being in nature has a profound impact on our brains and our behaviour; helping us to reduce anxiety and stress, and increase our attention capacity, creativity, and even our ability to connect with other people.
    - We at Active Escapes have always felt that, and that is why all our trips take place in beautiful natural surrounds, far from the madding crowds.
    - <em>Sometimes it’s just about BEING in nature, and we have some great getaways where this can be….</em>
