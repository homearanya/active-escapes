    - If you're the kind of person who likes to crank things up a notch, then white-water rafting is definitely for you. Tackling rapids under the expert eye of an experienced river guide, Active Escapes offers day and multi-day rafting tours on the mighty waters of the Tugela and Umkomaas Rivers.
    - The Tugela River flows from the towering heights of the Drakensberg Mountains, and meanders 502 kilometres through the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands to the Indian Ocean. This river offers spectacular scenery, fascinating Boer War history, serious white water and enough adventure material to keep the adrenalin pumping for a good while!
    - Famed for being the largest river on the South Coast, the Umkomaas has its source at Giant's Castle in the Berg. Also well-known for the gruelling 67km Umkomaas Canoe Marathon, you too can take advantage of the wild waters from the vantage of an inflatable croc.
