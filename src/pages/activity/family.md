    - In today’s digitally dominated world, it's easy to forget that holidays are supposed to be about spending real time with your family. Why go somewhere different just to plug in to the same old distractions? Why not go somewhere, where signal is poor and Wifi does not come with coffee.
    - Active Escapes believes in promoting fun, healthy holidays where children, spouses, and even you (that’s right, even you) are removed from the gadgets that have come to control our daily lives. Teach them to fish, ride bikes through the mud, go for walks, or bomb-drop into chilly river pools. Spend a night under the stars, build fires, toast marshmallows and have a connected family blast. Reconnect with your loved ones and destress in the process. This is what Active Escapes family holidays are all about, and we have plenty of ideas and places where you can do just this.

      title: Berg Escape to a family-run hotel
      subTitle: Hiking, horse-riding, fishing and games
      description: A third generation hotel, in the foothills of the Northern Berg. Unpretentious yet beautiful and serene, with a strong focus on family bonding and fun.  Join in on the daily guided hikes, an outride, or cast a line in one of the private dams on the property.  With facilitated activities for pre-schoolers and trained nannies for the tots, parents also get to enjoy a few precious hours of ‘time out’; whilst tweens and teens get an opportunity for new friendships and quality time with the family.
