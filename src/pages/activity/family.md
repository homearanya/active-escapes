    - For many people, walking is one of the greatest pleasures in life. Being surrounded by natural beauty and hiking with a few close friends and family is a wonderful way to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. In South Africa we are lucky to have a vast range of mountains, valleys, forests and coastlines; which hold incredible hiking, trekking and backpacking opportunities.
    - Active Escapes offer hiking holidays in the Drakensberg Mountains, the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, the Eastern Cape Highlands, Kosi Bay and along the entire length of the Wild Coast. Whether you're keen to summit lofty peaks with Vultures cruising the thermals, or have your sights set on sandy toeâ€™s and refreshing dips in the sea; Active Escapes will set your feet moving in the right direction.
  bestSeason: We have destinations for year-round, but best to avoid Dec-Jan school holidays
  locations: Drakensberg, Kosi Bay, EC Highlands, Wild Coast
