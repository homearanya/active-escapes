    - Tired of the same old company team builds? Run out of ideas for the staff Christmas party?  Or perhaps it’s time for the company’s seniors to brain storm and strategise?  Getting out into a remote and beautiful place is a great way to do this. Avoid the constant distractions of your mobile and everything else that comes with ‘the office’, and let us organise a novel location with fresh air and activity to get the brain cells firing.
    - With locations close to Durban and Johannesburg (the Drakensberg & KZN Midlands), or further afield but more remote  (Kosi Bay, Wild Coast) - Active Escapes can transform your next strategy session into a game-changer.
    - Likewise, over the years, we have customised many girl’s getaways, boys weekends, bulls and hens parties, or just intimate and unique gatherings for friends and families.  Many of our hikes are done by such groups and we have them coming back year-after-year with a new destination request.  Adventures like white water rafting also make for a great team-build or group getaway.
