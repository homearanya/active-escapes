    - Trail running is an outdoor pursuit growing at an exponential rate in South Africa. With our vast and varied landscapes; awesome trails unfold through mountains, along coastlines, and into out-of-the-way places that only the fit and adventurous get to experience.
    - Active Escapes offer trail running getaways on the Wild Coast, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and the Drakensberg. Using our point-to-point supported tours means you're left to run wild and free, while we transport your bags to the foot of the next bed, and ensure the beers are frosted on arrival.
    - The Lower Wild Coast hotel-hopping section and the Giants Cup Berg trail are two destinations with well positioned hotels / guest lodges and easier support logistics. However, many of our hiking products can potentially be trail run with some modifications to distances and logistics.
