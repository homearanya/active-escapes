    - In the Eastern Cape of South Africa, lies a stretch of land with a fascinating history. A former Bantustan in Apartheid days, the Wild Coast remained largely untouched as infrastructure was denied to this part of the country. Steep ravines, not particularly fertile soil, and a strong traditional base, has precluded much in the way of development since. From the Umtamvuma River in the north, to Kei River in the south, the Wild Coast is a tapestry of rolling green hills, steep-sided ravines, pristine estuaries and golden miles of sandy beach.
    - Traditional amaXhosa lifestyles are still the norm; with colourful huts decorating the hillsides as Nguni cows graze their way down to the beaches where they can enjoy a quiet afternoon of wave gazing.  Fishing and surfing are popular drawcards on the Wild Coast, but it is the miles of hard-pack beaches, jeep tracks and curvaceous hills that make the area a mecca for mountain bikers and hikers. Passing aloes and sisal as you rise and fall with the terrain; dolphins, whales and sea birds are sure to keep you company along the way.
    - Spending time on the Wild Coast is really about relaxing into its own special pace, a pace at which hidden secrets reveal themselves, from dramatic waterfalls to fresh feasts on local mussels and crays.
