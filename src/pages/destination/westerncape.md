    - Tipping the most southerly section of South Africa is the wonderful Western Cape. Edged by the Atlantic Ocean on the west, and the Indian Ocean on the east; the Western Cape is famed for its diverse climates.
    - Most of the Western Cape is classified as 'Mediterranean' and is dominated by the sandstone Cape Fold Mountains. The interior sports semi-arid conditions typical of the mystical Karoo, and as one heads up the east coast the environment mellows into a maritime climate, feeding dense moisture into the green forests of the Garden Route.
    - Boasting the endemic Cape Floral Kingdom with nostalgic whiffs of Fynbos underfoot; the Western Cape is exceptionally popular with local and international holiday-makers. Whether it's strolling from one vineyard to the next on the Winelands Trail, dossing down in luxury B&Bs after a day of dedicated strandloping, or whale watching along the coast, there's something for everyone in this foot of the country.
