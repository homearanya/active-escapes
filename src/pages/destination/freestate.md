  text:
    - In the eastern part of South Africa a lengthy volcanic spine of escarpment lies in prehistoric slumber, a magical place that has drawn humans to its peaks and crevices for hundreds of years. Rising to over 3000m, the Drakensberg mountain range is a super-sized playground of lofty terrain for hikers, climbers, photographers and active families.
    - Active Escapes offers the full spectrum of hiking adventure from sleeping in caves on the top of the escarpment; to luxury ‘slackpacking’ with comfortable lodgings and luggage support. We also offer horseback adventures, multi-day mountain bike tours, trout fishing expeditions and trail running in the berg.
  bestSeason: Mar – Nov
  locations: Northern, Southern Berg & Maluti’s.
