  text:
    - With the Drakensberg Mountains lying in stark contrast to the thorny bushveld of the Tugela Valley, central KwaZulu-Natal is a fascinating mix of Anglo-Boer history, wide open spaces and deeply gorged rivers.
    - The legacy of the violent struggles fought between the English, Boers and Zulus, is very apparent in the area, with dozens of war memorials, museums and battle sites paying homage to these bloody battles. But aside from the turbulent memories that lie quietly in the KZN dust, the Tugela Valley is an exciting and somewhat under-utilised active holiday destination.
    - Whether its zapping down the red earth trails, or navigating the white waters of the mighty Tugela river which winds its way through the hinterland, KwaZulu’s Natal’s interior has plenty of adventures in store.
