    - Lying comfortably at the foothills of the Drakensberg, lies a fertile strip of rolling farmlands known colloquially as the Midlands. Having the advantage of being close to the mountains and to the N3, the Midlands offers the perfect middle-distance option for people who want a short break from big city life.
    - "The rolling green hills, clean air and quaint historical buildings make for a picturesque backdrop and provided brilliant fodder for creative minds. In the 1970's many artists and crafters settled into the Midlands permanently, and by the mid-80's were working collaboratively to exhibit and sell their work. This small co-op grew organically to become the Midlands Meander: an easy to navigate, slowly unfolding tourist route that leads from cheesery to pottery to country restaurant to microbrewery and beyond."
    - While the Midlands Meander is well-known for shopping and lazy lunches, these days it’s also known for its extensive mountain biking, trail-running and hiking offerings. The small town of Howick is home to a network of single-track linking to the Karkloof forests; whilst cross country jeep tracks connect across private farmland to Lotheni and in to the Kamberg.
