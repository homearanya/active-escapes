  text:
    - In the north-eastern reaches of KwaZulu-Natal, hugging the Mozambican border, is a bay comprising four interconnected lakes which filter into the sea via a sandy estuary. The tropical weather and chilled vibes, makes Kosi Bay a year-round holiday destination.
    - Stepping from fern and swamp forests, into mangroves, then grasslands, and up the coastal dune forests; one gets a feeling for the diversity of ecosystems that exists in this unique conservancy – the northern most tip of iSimangaliso’s Wetland Park.
    - The best way to explore the area is by foot; making your way between the lala palms, cycads and mangroves, and taking to the water for snorkelling in Kosi Mouth. We have a number of slackpacking options which circumnavigate the lakes, and a few that combine the lakes with the pristine beaches down to Lala Nek and Mabibi.
    - From November to February, the magnificent Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles can be seen coming ashore to lay their eggs, and Active Escapes can arrange private guided viewings for interested groups.
